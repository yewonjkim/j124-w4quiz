## Week 4 Quiz, Question 6

The question I picked was ***“Given the opportunity, would you eliminate the possibility of reclining seats on planes entirely?”*** from the dataset. I found this question to be interesting because responding *“Yes”* would mean the respondent is willing to sacrifice their own comfort of reclining their seat, just so that other passengers don’t recline theirs. When examining the dataset, I noticed that just because a respondent thinks reclining seats on a plane is rude, that does not mean that they respond that reclining seats should be eliminated entirely. This is likely because many passengers recognize the certian level of comfort they receive from being able to recline their own seat, and would not want to take that away from their own benefits. 

My chart ***“Should Reclining Seats Be Eliminated on Planes?”*** shows that **595** respondents answered *“No”* while **259** respondents answered *“Yes."* These results indicate that more than twice as many people prefer keeping reclining seats over eliminating them, likely due to the individual comfort they value from reclining their own seats during flights.
